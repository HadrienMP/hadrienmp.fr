    summary: |-
      Sunday is a mobile app that allows restaurant customers to split and pay their bill without leaving their table.   
      <br>
      I was hired, with a senior team, to rewrite the whole app in Java and React. The previous prototype proved very hard to evolve. 
      I implemented the building blocks for our chosen architecture : __Micro Services, CQRS and Event Sourcing__.
      I trained my teamates in functional style programming, trunk based developement, mob and pair programming.
      <br>  
      Although the majority of my time I spent working on the mobile web front end in React. Especially: taxes, receipts, authentication and customer space.

      We focused on performance to handle a big increase in users and data. Implementing __CQRS__ helped divide by 10 page loading times. 
      We also __accelerated the delivery__ and reduced the bug frequency by switching to full time __Mob Programming__.
